# FreeRTOS_STM32F411_BMP280_AbsoluteAveraging
This FreeRTOS programs uses C programming language that enables the STM32 mcu to get the pressure data from the BMP280 sensor through I2C communication channel.

The absolute averaging is implemented to gain a stable value of pressure.



## Requirements

 **1 STM32F411**
  
 **2 BMP280**
  
 **3 STM32CUBEMX**
  
 **4 Keil/Eclipse  (I'm using Keil)**


## How to use this
You need to build the project using stm32cubemx software.
I had provided the .ioc file for this purpose

Utilize the Inc and Src files.
